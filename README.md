# MIR-Final-Project

This is the final project for the MIR course at NYU 2022 Fall.

In this project, we aim to build a pipeline to allow users to generate music automatically and transfer to their prefered timbres.

For generation models, Coconet by Magenta and MuseNet by OpenAI is combined. The inputs should be MIDI files.

For the timbre synthesis part, MIDI-DDSP by Magenta is used.
